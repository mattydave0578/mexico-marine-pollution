## 🔬 Key Findings

### Major Plastic Discharge
- **12 major rivers** discharge **>148,000 tons of plastic annually** into Mexican seas
- **Top polluter**: Ruíz River (Nayarit) - **77,592 tons/year** → Pacific Ocean
- **Second**: Pánuco-Guayalejo system - **26,719 tons/year** → Gulf of Mexico (drains Mexico City wastewater)

### Hydrocarbon Contamination
- **North Central Gulf of Mexico**: **173% increase** in PAH exposure (2015-2017)
- Highest contamination adjacent to Mississippi River Delta
- Mean biliary PAH levels: **640 µg/g** in some species (comparable to post-oil spill levels)

### Marine Debris Documentation
- **Veracruz Reef System**: 57% of seafloor debris is fishing gear
- **Cozumel Island**: 91% of beach debris is plastic (70% single-use items)
- **Cancún Region**: 57% of commercial fish contain microplastics (>1,000 particles)
- **Mexican Central Pacific**: 1,820 floating marine debris objects surveyed - 79.7% plastic
